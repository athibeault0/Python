In order to make manipulations/ calculations with the NumPy, we first have to run the data frame through the df['column'].to_numpy() method to change each column to an array before being able to work with it. Pandas on the other hand, seems to allow us to be able to work with the data frame/ columns as soon as the data is read in from the source file to a data frame. This is just my initial opinion, I'm sure further down the line we will learn better ways to interact with NumPy that make it advantageous over Pandas."]}]}
