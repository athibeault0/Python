The method .isna() confirmed our findings, apart from the significant number of missing values for the two %--- columns, all other values are present. We were also able to confirm there are no duplicated rows in the data. Lastly, we were able to collect the summary statistics for our numeric columns from .describe() to find the max average air temp of 13.346659, the min average air temp of 0.674699, and so on. An interesting find from the .describe() method: the average of % of Precip as Snow and % of Precip as Rain are quite high (83.65500 and 76.208075, respectively).
