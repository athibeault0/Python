The demonstration video has a basic overview of how to do this. Try this independently to build on some of the skills introduced thus far.  \n","\n","By the end of this assignment, you will:\n","\n","1. Mount your Google Drive to Colab \n","2. Import a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame\n","3. Convert a Pandas DataFrame into a CSV file\n","4. Download the CSV file to your local machine\n","5. Reflect on this first experience using Colab\n","\n","\n","Follow the subsequent steps to import the `birds.csv` file into your Google Colaboratory environment as a Pandas DataFrame, explore the data, and export your new dataset.\n","\n","Although this activity includes instructions, you must appropriately comment your code. Failure to do so will result in point deductions.\n","\n","Suppose you get stuck at any point in the activity. Post your code to the discussion forum in Canvas. We can debug code in the forum, which will help you and your classmates learn more coding skills!\n","\n","**Note:** You must post more than 24 hours before the assignment deadline to ensure a response."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Task 1: Setup Workspace\n","\n","Using the `Code snippets` tool in the lower left hand corner of the Colab interface (<> icon), mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment.
